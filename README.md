This app will allow avid readers to keep track of the books that they have read or desire to read.

Users can add books to their list manually using the form or can search hundreds of books using the http://openlibrary.org API in order to update your personal book list.

Your book list is stored in local storage and can be displayed in the book carousel (with actual pages that turn) or in tabular form. The book list can even be exported as a .csv file.
